This folder contains the specification document(hw1.pdf), example code originally provided(fib_fork.c;BinaryParity.java), as well as my solution to the problem(binary_parity.c).
In this assignment we were given a recursive function written in Java, and were asked to translate this function into C using fork() waitpid() and exit() instead of returns.
